Text Magic - React Function-Based Component Project

Text Magic is an exciting project created using React, aimed at providing users with a hands-on experience in developing function-based components while exploring various useful text manipulation functions. This project allows users to perform operations such as converting text to lowercase, uppercase, clearing the text, copying it to the clipboard, and even switching between dark and light modes.

React's function-based components offer a flexible and efficient way to build user interfaces, and Text Magic harnesses their power to create a dynamic and interactive text manipulation tool. By working on this project, developers can gain valuable insights into React's component lifecycle, state management, and the use of hooks.

The primary features of the Text Magic project include:

Lowercase Conversion: Users can enter text into an input field, and with the click of a button, the text will be transformed into lowercase characters. This feature showcases the simplicity and effectiveness of React's function components.

Uppercase Conversion: Similar to the lowercase conversion, this feature enables users to convert their text into uppercase characters, emphasizing the reusability of components and the ease of implementation in React.

Clear Text: The project also includes a clear button that, when clicked, resets the input field, allowing users to start fresh. This feature demonstrates how React components can respond to user actions and modify the UI accordingly.

Copy to Clipboard: Users can copy the transformed text to their clipboard by clicking a copy button. This functionality showcases React's ability to interact with browser APIs and perform actions beyond the scope of the virtual DOM.

Dark/Light Mode: Text Magic provides users with the option to switch between dark and light modes. By toggling a switch, the UI's color scheme will change, offering a delightful visual experience. This feature highlights the versatility of React components and the ease of incorporating styling and theming options.

Through building Text Magic, I can enhance my understanding of function-based components, learn how to manage state using React hooks, and gain valuable experience in creating reusable and interactive UI components. The project also serves as a foundation for further exploration into more complex React concepts and applications.

By experimenting with Text Magic, I was able to sharpen my React skills and acquire the necessary knowledge to create more sophisticated applications that leverage the power of this popular JavaScript library.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
